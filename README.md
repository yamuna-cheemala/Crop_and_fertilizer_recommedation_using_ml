# Week-1
# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation using Machine Learning (Week 1)
This project aims to build a crop and fertilizer recommendation system based on environmental and soil conditions. The first week's focus was on data exploration, analysis, and understanding the dataset that will be used for building the recommendation model.

# Key Activities (Week 1):

# Dataset Loading and Exploration: 
Loaded the dataset Crop_recommendation.csv containing features like temperature, humidity, and soil type for different regions, alongside crop labels.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: 
Checked for missing values, duplicates, and performed initial statistical analysis to understand data distributions.
# Data Visualization:
Visualized the distribution of crops using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand crop patterns.
# Feature Analysis: 
Analyzed the relationship between various environmental factors and the crop labels.
# Tools and Libraries Used:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
